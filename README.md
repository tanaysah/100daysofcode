Welcome to my 100 Days of Code in C repository! 🎉
This project documents my learning journey through the C programming language during my first semester of college. It covers everything from the absolute basics to advanced concepts—all organized, coded, and practiced day by day.

Special thanks to my professors, classmates, online resources, and the coding community for helping me grow as a developer.
